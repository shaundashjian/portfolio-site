                I'm an effective problem solver. I like solving problems. And that is exactly why I chose my career in software development. I have spent 7 successful years in the software industry, taking roles from tester to lead QA engineer to Scrum Master and project
                manager, in various domains, and organizations of various sizes. And now I have decided to start a new and exciting phase in my career and become a full-stack web developer. After enjoying leading many software teams to many successful
                deliveries, here I am choosing to be a team member actually building the solution.

                While I have already received my Master's degree in Computer Science before I started my career, I decided to go back to school and receive intensive hands-on 16-week training in the latest full-stack Java web development technologies delivered by Skill
                Distillery. I chose Skill Distillery because they have designed their bootcamp to cover the full range of full-stack development, teaching the skills employers seek the most in their developers. It's a very effective program and I am very
                pleased that I have chosen to receive my training to venture in my new career from them.
